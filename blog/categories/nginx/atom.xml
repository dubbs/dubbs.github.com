    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Apache</h2>

<p>Apache was designed to process web requests in a <strong>consistent</strong> and <strong>reliable</strong> manner.</p>

<p>It uses a <strong>process-driven</strong> architecture and handles one connection per-process or per-thread.</p>

<p>Apache comes with 2 multi processing modules (MPM), which bind to ports, accept requests and spawn processes:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Prefork</strong> MPM</p>

<p> Uses multiple child processes with one thread each.
 Each process handles one connection at a time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Worker</strong> MPM</p>

<p> Uses multiple child processes with many threads each.
 Each thread handles one connection at a time.
 If you want to use mod_php (not thread safe), it is recommended that you also use FastCGI, so that php is running in its own memory space.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Apache does not scale well under high server load, often consuming large amounts of RAM and CPU.</p>

<p>With Apache, it is easy to configure complex setups, it has excellent documentation and abundant module availability.</p>

<h2>Nginx</h2>

<p>Nginx was designed to solve the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C10k_problem">c10k problem</a>, and as a result, is a highly performant http and reverse proxy server.</p>

<p>It uses an <strong>event-driven</strong> architecture and handles multiple connections
in a single event loop.</p>

<p>Nginx is very good at serving <em>static content</em>, which accounts for 80 &ndash; 95% of website requests.
It scales very well under high server load, and is not dependent on the underlying server hardware.</p>

<p>Compared to other more established web servers,
complex site configuration is typically more difficult with Nginx,
due to lightweight design.  It also lacking in documentation and module support.</p>

<p>Some notable sites using Nginx include:</p>

<ul>
<li>github</li>
<li>wordpress</li>
<li>pinterest</li>
<li>netflix</li>
<li>cloudflare</li>
</ul>


<h2>Both?</h2>

<p>Nginx can be used as a reverse proxy, in front of Apache, handling all
requests for static content.  All other requests are forwarded to
Apache via <code>proxypass</code>.  You will need to install mod_rpaf, so
Apache can pick up the <code>X-Real-IP</code> header provided by nginx.  This will make
it seem as though Apache handled the original request.</p>
